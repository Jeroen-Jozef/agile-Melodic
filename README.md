# agile-Melodic

## Consolidation challenge
In this exercise we (see below) are learning the agile philosopy through the Scrum methodology. We invented a new company that translates lyrics from one lagnuage to the other using three APIs:
* api.chartlyrics for getting the song lyrics
* translate.yandex.net to actually translate the songs

## Objectives
* Learn to work in groups with an Agile approach
* Learn the value of stand up meetings and SCRUM
* Use some AB testing
* Use google analytics

## You can always count on me for

help with HTML, CSS and Javascript to some extent. But in fact feel free to ask me whatever is bothering you and I'll see if I can help out.

## Funny story

A few days ago I was having trouble with me ecard reader. Trying to fix it, swearing, calling helpdesk even, which is not something I usually do.
Erm... I had inserted the card upside down.

### TL;DR

If that was to long to read, I suggest you follow other classes first ;-)
